      <p> <font size="+2"> Hi, there! How are you? Hope you're having a nice day. My name is <i> Esin</i>. I am from Izmir, Turkey, and currently, in my final semester as a graduate student in New York City majoring in data analytics. Previously, I studied psychology in Berkeley, CA.</p> 
      
      <p>I am working as a full-time technology consultant and part-time research assistant. In the near future, I want to continue learning and put my knowledge of qualitative and quantitative research into work. I would love to be part of a team that aims to improve people's lives and solve global challenges. </p></font>

                <p> <font size="+2"><div style="text-align:left"><strong>My favorite projects so far?</strong> 

                Conducting research on the associations between parents’ parenting style and adult depression and anxiety at UC Berkeley. I recruited international participants and utilized an online survey through Qualtrics to assess the various parenting styles and both depression and anxiety symptoms. I gathered information on demographics, used the Parenting Style Questionnaire to measure the parents’ parenting style, The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) to measure depression, and the 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale to evaluate anxiety symptoms. Then I conducted a correlation test, constructed bivariate linear models to analyze the effects of parenting style on adult depression and anxiety, and used multiple variable regressions to further my understanding. Finally, I visualized my findings. </p> 
                 <p><strong>Results:</strong>
                    <p>    -  Authoritative parenting predicts less adult depression. </p></li>
                    <p>    -  There is no significant relationship between parenting style and adult anxiety. </p></li>

                (R was used for this project.) </p>
            
                <p>I also enjoyed working on a project with two of my classmates to understand more about the collisions in NYC in order to help reduce collisions, injuries, and fatalities. I used Python for this project and it can be found <a href= "https://github.com/CorkCork/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/" target="-blank"> here.</a></p>

                <p>I recently finished writing a report on AutoML and AutoML vendors and the process was intriguing.</p>
                
                <p>Last but not least, helping a non-profit nature conservation project in Germany and the development of a Rock'n'Roll Museum project in Ireland were very pleasurable and educative.</p>

                <p><strong>Some of the relevant courses I took?</strong>

                Product Design, Clinical Psychology, Personality Psychology, Social Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Analytics Programming, Computational Math and Statistics, Visual Design and Storytelling, Structured Data Management, Data-Driven Organizations, Health Psychology, Web Analytics, Marketing Management and Strategy, Clinical Neuropsychology, Research and Data Analytics, Scientific Approaches to Consciousness, Developmental Psychology, Developmental Psychopathology</p>

                <p><strong>My secret weapon?</strong> Learning fast. One can tell me about a tool that I have no idea about and in a few days, I can finish a project with it. I love research and that helps.</p>
                
                <p><strong>My weakness?</strong> Not being good at thinking fast. I need time to collect information to come up with ideas and solutions. </p>
                
                 <p><strong>Ultimate goals/dreams?</strong> 1- Starting a non-profit social enterprise to bridge the gap between underserved and high-income communities through impact sourcing. 2- Building a farm community for orphans and the lonely elderly. Basically an orphanage and nursing home in one place (with stray animals).</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Interests?</strong> User experience research; technical and UX writing; human-computer interaction; machine learning; market research; health; art therapy; social, economic, and political equality; social inclusion; underserved communities; accessibility; sustainability; philosophy; short films; drums; ukulele; rock climbing; cross-stitching; puppetry; hooping; living in different countries<small> (so far 5 countries)</small>; 90’s and early 00’s sitcoms; race walking; and dance <small> (ballet and contemporary a.k.a as Homer Simpson would call it <a href= "https://youtu.be/f1DGp9zXs3o?t=255" target="-blank"> "boring")</small></a> </p>
