      <p> <font size="+2"> Hi, there! How are you? Hope you're having a nice day. I'm <i> Esin</i>. I am from Izmir, Turkey, and currently, a graduate student in New York City majoring in data analytics. Previously, I studied psychology in Berkeley, CA.</p> 
      
      <p>I am interested in user experience research and looking forward to putting my love and knowledge of qualitative and quantitative research into work to help others in some way. My philosophy: Be user oriented and lead the process with empathy.

                <p> <font size="+2"><div style="text-align:left"><strong>My favorite projects so far?</strong> 

                Conducting research on the associations between parents’ parenting style and adult depression and anxiety at UC Berkeley. I recruited international participants and utilized an online survey through Qualtrics to assess the various parenting styles and both depression and anxiety symptoms. I gathered information on demographics, used the Parenting Style Questionnaire to measure the parents’ parenting style, The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) to measure depression, and the 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale to evaluate anxiety symptoms. Then I conducted a correlation test on anxiety and depression levels, constructed bivariate linear models to analyze the effects of parenting style on adult depression and anxiety, and used multiple variable regressions to further my understanding. Finally, I visualized my findings. </p> 
                 <p><strong>Results:</strong>
                    <p>    -  Authoritative parenting predicts less depression. </p></li>
                    <p>    -  There is no significant correlation between parenting style and adult anxiety. However, there is a non-significant negative correlation between adult anxiety and the authoritative parenting style.</p></li>

                (R was used for this project.) </p>
            
                <p>I also enjoyed working on a project to understand more about the collisions in NYC in order to help reduce collisions, injuries, and fatalities. I used Python for this project and it can be found <a href= "https://github.com/CorkCork/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/" target="-blank"> here.</a></p>
                
                <p>Last but not least, not technology-related but helping a non-profit nature conservation project in Germany and the development of a Rock'n'Roll Museum project in Ireland were very pleasurable and educative.</p>
             
                <p><strong>My secret weapon?</strong> Learning fast. One can tell me about a tool that I have no idea about and in a few days, I can finish a project with it. I love research and that helps.</p>
                
                <p><strong>My weakness?</strong> Not being good at thinking fast. I need time to collect information to come up with ideas and solutions. </p>
                
                <p><strong>Dream Job?</strong> I’m interested in work that involves qualitative and quantitative research. I'd love to turn data into insights on progress towards a more equal and inclusive world.
                
                 <p><strong>Ultimate goals/dreams?</strong> 1- Starting a non-profit social enterprise to bridge the gap between underserved and high-income communities through impact sourcing. 2- Building a farm community for orphans and the lonely elderly. Basically an orphanage and nursing home in one place (with stray animals).</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Interests?</strong> Underserved communities; accessibility; sustainability; philosophy; drums; ukulele; rock climbing; cross-stitching; living in different countries<small>(so far 5 countries)</small>; 90’s and early 00’s sitcoms; fast walking; mindfully getting lost in different; and dance <small> (ballet and contemporary a.k.a as Homer Simpson would call it <a href= "https://youtu.be/f1DGp9zXs3o?t=255" target="-blank"> "boring")</small></a> </p>
